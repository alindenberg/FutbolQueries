# FutbolQueries
An application that allows users to make interesting queries within a database that holds league, team, and player information from soccer organizations across the globe. Using CasperJs to scrape data from the web, Oracle, SQL, and PHP to maneuver the backend, and HTML combined with Bootstrap we made the application come to life.
